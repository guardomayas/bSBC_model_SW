# Na/K ATPase Models

## Ground truth: some kind of post albers 6 step reaction.
1. Lots of parameters.
2. Well explained in mathematical physiology  book.

$I_{\text{pump}} = \frac{I_{\text{pump}}^{\text{max}}}{1 + \exp\left(\frac{[\text{Na}]_{\text{ih}} - [\text{Na}]_{\text{i}}}{[\text{Na}]_{\text{is}}}\right)}$

## Sodium and potassium dependent model

1. Ion concentration dynamics as a mechanism for neuronal bursting: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10867-010-9212-6
 
 ${\tilde I}_{\rm pump}=\rho {\left( {1 +     \exp \left( {\frac{{25 - {{\rm [Na]}_i}}}{3}} \right)} \right)^{-1}} \left( {\frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( {5.5 - {{\rm [K]}_o}} \right)}}} \right)$

3. A mathematical model of recurrent spreading depolarizations https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-017-0675-3


$I_{P} = \rho_{N} \left( \frac{[\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{e}}{2 + [\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{e}}\right)^{2}\left( \frac{[\text{Na}^{+}]_{i}}{7.7 + [\text{Na}^{+}]_{i}}\right)^{3}$

## There is also a Voltage dependent model
The main advantage would be not having the need to model Na concentration. Howeverr, I'm concerned about peformarce

- Clarifying the composition of the ATP consumption factors required for maintaining ion homeostasis in mouse rod photoreceptors uses that model
    - Inspired by Gabriel's paper (https://rupress.org/jgp/article-standard/153/2/e202012687/211728/Loss-of-the-K-channel-Kv2-1-greatly-reduces).
